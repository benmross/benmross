EDUCATION: Junior, Science, Math, Computer Science Magnet Program at Poolesville High School

PROJECTS

- Large Language Model Fine-Tuning - Using a dataset of every text I’ve ever sent or received, I’m currently developing a targeted method of fine-tuning Meta’s open-source large language model, Llama 3.1, to respond to texts in a manner indistinguishable from myself. I’m leveraging Google’s Cloud Compute services for each training iteration and have been experimenting with different training parameters to minimize loss in response accuracy.
- Independent App Development - I’m a core programmer on a small team of student developers, and for the past few months we have been iteratively designing a mobile app to assist with student mental health throughout our school district. We’re in the final stages of alpha development and are in contact with representatives from our school system for the purpose of forming an official partnership.
- Home Server - Using a collection of Docker containers, I created and configured a home media server on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with the capability to stream media throughout my home. The challenges that came from running this on low powered hardware taught me about the benefits of containerization, as well as how different hardware acceleration methods can be adapted for low-spec devices.
- Software Development for a Staff Member - I was the lead programmer of a team of students that developed room reservation software for an administrator at our school. I handled both backend and frontend development, and utilized HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and a MongoDB remote database.
- Mock Networks - To prepare for my upcoming Computer Networking class, I have conducted many network and vulnerability scanning experiments in the controlled environment of a mock network. I’ve become proficient in adapting Nmap for use on different subnets and understanding Wireshark capture files to extract data.

SKILLS

- Presentations - Every project in my magnet program culminates with a final presentation, where each team shares their research and development process with their peers and other staff members. I have consistently been a top performer in these events and have honed my skills of public speaking and conveying information in both a concise and precise manner.
- Team Management - Throughout the educational projects I’ve done, I’ve worked with many different teams. Often, I end up being the team manager, and I’ve learned that every team member brings value to the group. I’ve learned how to ensure that deadlines are met and that our team communicates fluently.
